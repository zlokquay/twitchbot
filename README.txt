Commands:
!board - shows the current board the streamer is using

!setboard (url) - allows the streamer to set the url for the board. 
  parameter (url) - the url of the board.
  !setboard only works for those with whitelisted names. To set a name as a whitelisted name, you   have to open the app.js file with a text editor of your choice (notepad++, atom, SUMBLIME) and add   the names to the "channels" array in the options variable.
